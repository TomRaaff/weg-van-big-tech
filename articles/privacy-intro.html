      <p>
        Privacy is a process. How far do you want to go? In every data
        processing step, there are multiple parties involved. You can start
        with making private your part and demand that the other parties do
        their part as well. How much legislation is there to help you achieve
        that? Not much unfortunatelly. Present internet is built around the
        idea that behavior of users can be monitored, analyzed and monetized
        in exchange for "free" services. If you don't pay for a service, then
        you're the product being traded. That's what you consent with by
        accepting tracking and 3rd party cookies in your browsers. Most of the
        apps you install on your phone do this automatically under the hood.
